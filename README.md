# E-commerce-product-page
This is my solution to the Fronend Mentor Challange (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). In this Project I was practicing Css (transition properties, flexbox etc) and Javascript skills like a lightbox product gallery and cart functionality. 


## Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
